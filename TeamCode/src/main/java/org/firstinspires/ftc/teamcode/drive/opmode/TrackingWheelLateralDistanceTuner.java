/**
 * Opmode designed to assist the user in tuning the `StandardTrackingWheelLocalizer`'s
 * LATERAL_DISTANCE value. The LATERAL_DISTANCE is the center-to-center distance of the parallel
 * wheels.
 *
 * Tuning Routine:
 *
 * 1. Set the LATERAL_DISTANCE value in StandardTrackingWheelLocalizer.java to the physical
 * measured value. This need only be an estimated value as you will be tuning it anyways.
 *
 * 2. Make a mark on the bot (with a piece of tape or sharpie or however you wish) and make an
 * similar mark right below the indicator on your bot. This will be your reference point to
 * ensure you've turned exactly 360°.
 *
 * 3. Although not entirely necessary, having the bot's pose being drawn in dashbooard does help
 * identify discrepancies in the LATERAL_DISTANCE value. To access the dashboard,
 * connect your computer to the RC's WiFi network. In your browser, navigate to
 * https://192.168.49.1:8080/dash if you're using the RC phone or https://192.168.43.1:8080/dash
 * if you are using the Control Hub.
 * Ensure the field is showing (select the field view in top right of the page).
 *
 * 4. Press play to begin the tuning routine.
 *
 * 5. Use the right joystick on gamepad 1 to turn the bot counterclockwise.
 *
 * 6. Spin the bot 10 times, counterclockwise. Make sure to keep track of these turns.
 *
 * 7. Once the bot has finished spinning 10 times, press A to finishing the routine. The indicators
 * on the bot and on the ground you created earlier should be lined up.
 *
 * 8. Your effective LATERAL_DISTANCE will be given. Stick this value into your
 * StandardTrackingWheelLocalizer.java class.
 *
 * 9. If this value is incorrect, run the routine again while adjusting the LATERAL_DISTANCE value
 * yourself. Read the heading output and follow the advice stated in the note below to manually
 * nudge the values yourself.
 *
 * Note:
 * It helps to pay attention to how the pose on the field is drawn in dashboard. A blue circle with
 * a line from the circumference to the center should be present, representing the bot. The line
 * indicates forward. If your LATERAL_DISTANCE value is tuned currently, the pose drawn in
 * dashboard should keep track with the pose of your actual bot. If the drawn bot turns slower than
 * the actual bot, the LATERAL_DISTANCE should be decreased. If the drawn bot turns faster than the
 * actual bot, the LATERAL_DISTANCE should be increased.
 *
 * If your drawn bot oscillates around a point in dashboard, don't worry. This is because the
 * position of the perpendicular wheel isn't perfectly set and causes a discrepancy in the
 * effective center of rotation. You can ignore this effect. The center of rotation will be offset
 * slightly but your heading will still be fine. This does not affect your overall tracking
 * precision. The heading should still line up.
 *
 * NOTE: this has been refactored to use FTCLib's command-based
