# Road Runner FTCLib Quickstart

**CURRENTLY IN PRODUCTION**

An example FTC project using [Road Runner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner) with a dependency for [FTCLib](https://www.github.com/FTCLib/FTCLib) to set up a command-based project.

## Installation

For more detailed instructions on getting Road Runner setup in your own project, see the [Road Runner README](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner#core).

1. Download or clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/FTCLib/RoadRunner-FTCLib-Quickstart.git`.

1. Open the project in Android Studio and build `TeamCode` like any other `ftc_app` project.

1. If you have trouble with multidex, enable proguard by changing `useProguard` to `true` in `build.common.gradle`.

## Documentation

Check out the new [online quickstart documentation](https://acme-robotics.gitbook.io/road-runner/quickstart/introduction).

Unofficially, there is also [LearnRoadRunner](https://www.learnroadrunner.com/) made by Noah. It's a great guide for getting started with the quickstart!
